Contributors to neat-gru-rust may optionally add themselves to this list of
authors if they choose to do so. This is optional because the git history is
good enough for that purpose, and in fact most projects do not maintain such a
manual list.

(Authors keep copyright of their contributions, of course; they just grant
a license to everyone to use it as detailed in LICENSE.)
